# radiotextual

radiotextual is a tool to update the radio text field in RDS on an Orban
Optimod 8700 using data from Trackman.

Unlike Trackman itself, this code is available under the GPLv3 to allow
modifications to be made for specific production uses without a requirement to
offer the source code.
